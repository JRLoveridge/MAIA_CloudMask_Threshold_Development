#supporting directories with description
PTA_MODIS_files - MOD02/03/35 files (possibly MAIAC as well)
Database - data needed from MODIS products
MCM_Input - formatted input for MCM main code for each scene
thresh_dev/observables - observable for each scene
thresh_dev/OLP - observable level parameter (OLP) for each scene
thresh_dev/group - intermediate files that combine MOD35 CM anbd obs by OLP bin
thresh_dev/grouped_obs_and_CMs - combined group files by DOY
thresh_dev/thresholds - threshold files by DOY
results/MCM_Output - MCM output files for each scene
results/conf_matx_scene - confusion matrix for each scene
results/scene_accuracy - accuracy for each scene
